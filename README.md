# Historical-Building-Recognition-System
This historical building recognition system can perform classification of the historical buildings in Malacca, Malaysia. The model is trained with images of three historical buildings, namely Stadhuys, St Paul Church, and  A'Famosa. The images are taken from different angles and at different times of a day.
